        <h2>Dear Ishita,</h2>
        <p>I know Iâ€™ve messed up, and I can only imagine the disappointment Iâ€™ve caused. Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about us, about everything that went wrong, and more than anything, about how much I regret my actions.</p>
        <p>I hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry. You mean the world to me, and I wish I could take back the things I said and did. The love I have for you has always been the most important thing in my life, and I never intended to make you feel anything less than cherished.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m not perfect, but Iâ€™m trying to be a better version of myselfâ€”one who values you deeply and makes choices that reflect that love.</p>
        <p>Please know that my heart aches when I think of the pain I caused. Iâ€™m here, waiting for your forgiveness, hoping to show you just how much you mean to me.</p>
        <p>You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, and Iâ€™m willing to do whatever it takes to earn back your trust and your heart.</p>
        <p>With all my love,</p>
        <p>Rick</p>
